Changes
=======

The highlighted changes are shown for the following production releases. Each
 release will have included many additional new features and improvements.


0.4.1
-----

Design:
 - Moved aircraft tables (vspeeds, flap/slat/flaperon settings etc.) out of repository for copyright reasons 
 - Split segments type identification uses lack of Heading change to determine no movement and therefore a GROUND ONLY state. Prevents ground tests with valid Airspeed/Altitude triggering Start/Stop segments.
 - Flap and Flap Lever etc. are now string states, max_value and others now support these.
 - Support for A319, A320 and A320 families; e.g. Flap Lever (Synthetic) establishes lever position (0, 1, 2, 3, Full) from flap, slat and flaperon.
 - Nodes support setting of .sample_rate and .hz attributes which are properties to .frequency

Parameter and algorithms:
 - New parameter Dual Input above 200ft and Dual Input below 200ft (based on Sidestick)
 - Altitude Radio (A) and (B) overflow correction when merging into Altitude Radio (for Airbus)
 - Altitude Radio supports CRJ radio altimeter which reads positive on ground and rotates negative during  rotation
 - AOA supports just one source parameter or both
 - "Flap At..." KPVs all use "Flap" as the raw angle rather than Flap Lever.
 - Airspeed True extended for ground operations.
 - ILS Established enhanced to makes sure aircraft path converges onto the beam
 - thrust_reversers_working now returns the correct indexes to improve validity of related measurements
 - heightless kpvs nolonger triggered in descent
 - TCAS RA operates on warning parameter in preference to TCAS Combined Control
 - Second_window calls for large arrays are cast to integer type to save memory
 - Alternate Law no only measures while airborne
 - Master warning only measures while engines running


0.3.1
-----
 - Flap Angle supports more than two signals, including (C) and (MCP) channels
 - Improvements to Top Of Climb (find_toc_tod) and Bottom of Descent (uses just 
   ClimbCruiseDescent) make climbs and descents more robust.
 - ILS Frequency only reports valid frequency if both (1) and (2) channels are 
   recording same frequency.
 - Airspeed with Flap 0 and Slat something.
 - Support for Slat included in Flap Lever (Synthetic) to ensure slat only 
   transitions are included.

0.2.2
-----
 - Fix to nodes to calculate a new offset when aligning to a higher frequency
   to ensure offset does not exceed the time of the first sample

0.2.1
-----
 - Added analyzer profiles
 - Support for CL-600 Aircraft Families
 - Support for A340 Aircraft Families
 - Support for BD-100 Aircraft Families
 - Speedbrake refactoring
 - Added Airbus KPV's
 - Support for ground runs
 - Support for slat stepping
 - Clip replaced with second_window
  - Improves speed
  - Corrects truncation of adjacent peaks

0.0.6
-----

 - Support for Beechcraft 1900D.
 - Improved liftoff detection algorithm.


0.0.2
-----

 - Support for B757 / B767.

0.0.1
------

 - Initial release directed at B737.
